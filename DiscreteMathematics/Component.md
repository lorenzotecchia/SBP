The **components** of a [[graph]] $G$ are its maximal connected [[subgraph]].

The **connection relation** on the vertex set of a graph $G$ is the set of pairs $u,v \in V(G)$ such that $G$ has a *u,v-path*, we say: "*u* is connected to *v*" or "*u* and *v* are connected by a path".

A **connected set** of vertices is a set $S$ such that the induce [[subgraph]] $G[S]$ is [[connected]].

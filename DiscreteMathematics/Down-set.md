In a [[Poset]] $P$, a **down-set** os a subset $D$ such that $x\in D$ and $y<x$ imply $y \in D$. 

The down-set $D[x]$ **generated** by $x$ is {$y \in P: y\leq x$}. We also write $D(x)=\{y \in P: y<x\}$ 

The down-set $D[A]$ generated by a family $A$ is $\{y:y\leq x$ for some $x \in A\}$ .

Down-sets have also been called **ideal** or **oder ideals**.

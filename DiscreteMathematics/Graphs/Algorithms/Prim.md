**Prim's algorithm** is a [[greedy]] algorithm that finds a [[minimum spanning tree]] for a weighted [[undirected]] [[graph]]. This means it finds a subset of the edges that forms a [[tree]] that includes every vertex, where the total weight of all edges in the tree is minimised.
## proceeding of the algorithm
The algorithm may informally describe as performing these steps:
1. Initialise a tree with a single vertex, chosen arbitrarily from the graph
2. Grow the tree by one edge: Of the edges that connect the tree to vertices not yet in the tree, find the minimum-weight edge, and transfer it to the tree.
3. Repeat step 2 until all vertices are in the tree

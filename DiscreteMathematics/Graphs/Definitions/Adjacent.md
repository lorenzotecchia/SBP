Vertices $x$ and $y$ are **adjacent**(or **neighbours**) in a [[graph]] if $xy \in E(G)$. 

We may write $x \leftrightarrow y$  for "$x$ is adjacent to $y$" and $x \nleftrightarrow y$ for "$x$ is not adjacent to $y$", denoting the **adjacency** and **non-adjacency relations** on $V(G)$.

The **neighbourhood** $N_{G}(X)$ of $N(x)$ of a vertex $x$ is {$y \in V(G): xy \in E(G)$}.

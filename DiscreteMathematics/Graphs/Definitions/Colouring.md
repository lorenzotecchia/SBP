A **[[graph]] colouring** is the process of assigning a colour to each vertex so that each two [[adjacent]] vertices have different colours. In particular, the vertices of any [[clique]] must be all assigned different colours, so the [[chromatic number]] is always grater to the **clique number**, the number of vertices in the maximum clique.

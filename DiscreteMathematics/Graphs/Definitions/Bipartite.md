A [[graph]] is **bipartite** if $V(G)$ is the union of the two [[independent]] sets called its **parts**.

An $X,Y$-bigraph is a bipartite graph $G$ with parts $X$ and $Y$ and $(X,Y)$ is the a **bipartition** of $G$.

An $X,Y$-bigraph with all of $X$ [[adjacent]] to all of $Y$ is a **[[Complete|complete]]**   bipartite graph.

A $k$-**partite graph** is a graph whose vertex set is the union of $k$ [[independent]] set.

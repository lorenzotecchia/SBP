A **spanning forest** in a [[graph]] is a [[Subgraph|subgraph]] that is a [[forest]] with another additional requirement.

A **spanning forest** touches all the vertices in the subgraph.

A *full spanning forest* is a spanning forest with the same number of [[Component|components]] as the given graph.

This is a [[spanning tree]], but without the edge on the second row this would be a spanning forest.

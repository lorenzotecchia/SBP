A **graph** $G$ is an ordered pair consisting of a **vertex set** $V(G)$ and an **edge set** $E(G)$, where each **edge** is a set of two **vertices**. 

The vertices of an edge are its **endpoints**. We write $xy$ for an edge with endpoints $x$ and $y$.

The **order** of a graph $G$ is $|V(G)|$; its **size** is $|E(G)|$. ^246cf3

A graph with order n is an ***n-vertex graph***.

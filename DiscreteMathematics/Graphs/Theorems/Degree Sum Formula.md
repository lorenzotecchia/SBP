For a **[[graph]]** $G$ with $m$ edges, $$m = \frac{1}{2}\sum_{v \in V(G)}d(v)$$. 
Thus a **k-[[regular]]** n-vertex graph has $kn/2$ edges ($Q_{k}$ has $k2^{k-1}$ edges).

Every graph has an even number of vertices of odd [[degree]], and thus no [[regular]] graph of odd degree has an odd number of vertices.

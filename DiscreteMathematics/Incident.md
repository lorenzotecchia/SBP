Vertex $v$ and edge $e$ of a [[graph]] are **incident** id $v$ is an endpoint of $e$.

Also edges with a common endpoint are **incident**.

Given a vertex ordering $v_{1}\dots v_{n}$ and an edge ordering $e_{1}\dots e_{n}$ the **incident [[matrix]]** $M(G)$ is the $0,1$-matrix defined by $M_{i,j}=1$ if and only if $v_{i}\in e_{j}$.

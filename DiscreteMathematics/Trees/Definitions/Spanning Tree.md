A **spanning tree** $T$ of an [[undirected]] [[graph]] $G$ is a subgraph that is a [[Tree]] which includes all of the vertices of $G$.

In general, a graph may have several spanning trees, but a graph that is not [[connected]] will not contain a spanning tree([[Spanning Forest]]).

If all edges of $G$ are also edges of a spanning tree $T$ of $G$, then $G$ is a tree and is identical to $T$.

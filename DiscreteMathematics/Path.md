A **path** with $n$ vertices is a [[graph]] whose vertices can be named $v_{1}\dots v_{n}$ so that the edges are 
{$v_{i}v_{i+1}: 1 \leq i \leq n-1$}  $\bigcup$   {$v_{n}v_{1}$}. We write $v_{1}, \dots, v_n$ to specify this cycle. 

The **length** of a path or cycle is the number of edges.

A cycle is an **odd cycle**/**even cycle**  if its length is **odd**/**even**.

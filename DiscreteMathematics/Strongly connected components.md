In the mathematical theory of [[Undirected|directed graphs]], a [[graph]] is said to be **strongly connected** if every vertex is [[Reachability|reachable]] from every other vertex. The **strongly connected [[Component|components]]** of an arbitrary directed graph form a partition into [[Subgraph|subgraphs]] that are themselves strongly connected. It is possible to test the strong [[Connected|connectivity]] of a graph, or to find its strongly connected components, in [[linear time]](that is, Θ(_V_ + _E_)).


>[!In other Words]
>A [[Undirected|directed graph]] is called **strongly connected** if there is a [[path]] in each direction between each pair of vertices of the graph.

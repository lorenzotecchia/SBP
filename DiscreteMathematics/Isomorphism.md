An **isomorphism** from a [[graph]] $G$ to a graph $H$ is a bijection $f: V(G)$ such that $uv \in E(G)$ if and only if $f(u)f(v) \in E(H)$.

When an isomorphism exists,  we write $G \cong H$ and say "$G$ is isomorphic to $H$".

The **isomorphic relation** is the set of pairs $(G,H)$ such that $G \cong H$.

Placing more than $kn$ objects into $k$ classes puts more than n objects into some class.
>With at most $n$ objects per class, there are at most $kn$ objects.

If $(\sum p_{i})-k+1$ objects are put into $k$ classes with quotas $\{p_{i}\}$, then some class meet its quota.
>If not, then at most $\sum(p_{i}-1)$, objects can be accommodated.

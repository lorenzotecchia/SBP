A ***minimum spanning tree*** (**MST**) or a ***minimum weight spanning [[tree]]*** is a subset of the edges of a [[connected]], edge weighted undirected [[graph]] that connects all the vertices together, without any [[Cycle|cycles]] and with the minimum possible total edge weight.

That is, it is a [[Spanning Tree|spanning tree]] whose sum of edges weights as small as possible. More generally, any edge weighted [[Undirected|undirected]]  graph has a minimum spanning forest, which is a union of the minimum spanning trees for its [[connected]] [[component]]. ^509260
